# Status — esp32-cam-rtsp

**Last updated:** 2026-06-30
**Version:** 0.0.1-dev
**Active branch:** main

---

## Current State

Infrastructure components merged to main: sys_log, nvs_config (extended
with network_mode field), app_event, power_manager, wifi_manager (with
mutex-guarded reconnect task, cooperative shutdown, in-loop generation
guard, conditional BT linker dependency, concurrent-task tripwire),
status_indicator, sensor_registry. Test infrastructure (Unity host
tests) in place — 92 tests across 6 suites.
[env:native] PlatformIO environment ready — host tests runnable via both
pio test -e native and make -f test/Makefile. Firmware builds verified on
all three target boards (LilyGo T-Camera Plus, AI Thinker ESP32-CAM,
Olimex ESP32-POE). Primary board corrected to LilyGo T-Camera Plus
(ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3, OV2640, 4 MB flash, 8 MB quad PSRAM) and data-driven
board abstraction (Variant B) introduced — board data in `boards/<board>.h`,
dispatch via `#include CONFIG_BOARD_DATA_FILE` from Kconfig; adding a new
board requires no changes to `board.h` or any `.c` file (ESPCAMFW-54).
Data-driven sensor registry added — sensor data in `sensors/<sensor>.h`,
dispatch via `#include CONFIG_SENSOR_DATA_FILE` from Kconfig, with
compile-time DVP/MIPI interface-safety checks; adding a DVP sensor needs
no changes to `sensor_caps.h` or any `.c` file (ESPCAMFW-56).
CI hardened — GITHUB_TOKEN restricted to least-privilege permissions in
both GitHub Actions workflows (ESPCAMFW-53).

## What's Done

- **[ESPCAMFW-56]** ✅ Data-driven sensor registry + DVP/MIPI interface
  classification — `sensors/ov2640.h` / `sensors/ov5640.h` (pure `#define`),
  dispatcher `include/sensor_caps.h` (`#include CONFIG_SENSOR_DATA_FILE`, no
  sensor enumeration), new Kconfig-only component
  `components/sensor_registry/` (`choice SENSOR_TARGET`, default
  `SENSOR_OV2640`, mechanic (ii): per-board sdkconfig fragment selects the
  sensor); `BOARD_HAS_MIPI_CSI`/`BOARD_HAS_ISP` flags added to all three
  board files with completeness checks in `board.h`; compile-time `#error`
  guards block MIPI/ISP sensors on non-MIPI/non-ISP boards (ref ESPCAMFW-49,
  ADR-007); ADR-006 documents the registry, the (i)/(ii) decision, and the
  data-vs-driver and DVP/MIPI boundaries; 8 new host tests (92 total across
  6 suites, 0 failures); reviewed by Claude Opus — APPROVED WITH SUGGESTIONS,
  no Blocker/Critical findings (test asserts strengthened post-review)

- **[ESPCAMFW-55]** ✅ wifi_manager — BT REQUIRES fix (M3) + generation-guard
  in reconnect loop (P4-B) + tripwire — `components/wifi_manager/CMakeLists.txt`
  links `idf::bt` privately, conditional on `CONFIG_BT_CONTROLLER_ENABLED`
  (previously missing, would fail to link with BT controller enabled);
  `reconnect_task()` main loop now re-checks `s_reconnect_generation` under
  `s_reconnect_mutex` immediately after `ulTaskNotifyTake()`, so a task
  orphaned by a deinit-timeout + new init() cycle exits before calling
  `esp_wifi_connect()` or touching `s_attempt_count` (existing
  cleanup-section guard from ESPCAMFW-46 unchanged); new
  `s_active_reconnect_tasks` tripwire counter (mutex-guarded
  increment/decrement) emits `ESP_LOGE` if more than one reconnect task is
  active simultaneously; two `TODO #ESPCAMFW-47` anchors mark the deferred
  join-based teardown; ADR-002 documents the cooperative-shutdown model,
  Accepted Risk R2 (stack/TCB leak on timeout path), and alternatives
  considered; 2 new host tests (84 total, 0 failures); reviewed by Claude
  Opus — APPROVED, no Blocker/Major findings

- **[ESPCAMFW-54]** ✅ Board re-identification + data-driven abstraction —
  primary board corrected from LilyGo T-Display S3 (ESP32-S3) to LilyGo
  T-Camera Plus (ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3 rev 3.0, OV2640, 4 MB flash, 8 MB quad
  PSRAM, ST7789, CH9102F; verified esptool + schematic); `boards/<board>.h`
  data files (pure `#define`, no logic) replace inline `#if/#elif` chain in
  `board.h`; `include/board.h` dispatches via `#include CONFIG_BOARD_DATA_FILE`
  (Kconfig string option) + compile-time completeness validation; `partitions/
  partitions_4mb_ota.csv` replaces 16 MB S3 layout; all three envs get
  explicit `board_build.partitions`; sitewide rename of `lilygo-t-display-s3`
  / `BOARD_LILYGO_T_DISPLAY_S3` completed; ADR-004 documents the abstraction
  decision; 82 host tests, 0 failures; 3× firmware builds PASS, 0 warnings

- **[ESPCAMFW-53]** ✅ CI GITHUB_TOKEN least-privilege — explicit `permissions`
  blocks added to both GitHub Actions workflows; `ci.yml` workflow-level
  `contents: read`; `release.yml` top-level narrowed `write`→`read` with
  job-level `contents: write` only on the `release` job; closes CodeQL
  `actions/missing-workflow-permissions`; YAML-only change, no test-count impact
- **[ESPCAMFW-46]** ✅ wifi_manager orphaned reconnect task fix — generation
  counter `s_reconnect_generation` (uint32_t) incremented on every
  `wifi_manager_init()`; passed to `reconnect_task()` via `pvParameters`
  under `s_reconnect_mutex`; cleanup section guards `s_reconnect_task = NULL`
  via `reconnect_should_clear_handle()` helper — orphaned task exits silently
  without corrupting new task's handle; helper exposed via UNIT_TEST accessor
  for direct host-test coverage; 2 new host tests; 80 total, 0 failures
- **[ESPCAMFW-44]** ✅ wifi_manager race condition fix — `s_reconnect_task`
  now guarded by `s_reconnect_mutex` across all three concurrent contexts;
  cooperative shutdown replaces external `vTaskDelete`; force-clear on
  timeout path; mutex created before event handler registration;
  release-before-notify in event handler; unconditional state reset in
  `init()`; 2 new host tests (injected-handle cooperative path + timeout
  path); 78 host tests total, 0 failures; follow-up ESPCAMFW-46 created
- **[ESPCAMFW-43]** ✅ NVS mock namespace isolation -- handle table maps each
  nvs_open() call to a namespace; nvs_get_*/nvs_set_* scoped per handle;
  wildcard "*" fallback preserves all 39 nvs_config tests unchanged;
  s_last_write_ns tracks SUT write namespace (updated only on successful
  allocation; returns ESP_ERR_NO_MEM on overflow); new
  mock_nvs_set_str_val_ns() and mock_nvs_get_last_write_ns() helpers;
  test_save_credentials_writes_to_nvs now verifies "wifi_cfg" namespace
  explicitly; 75 host tests, 0 failures
- **[ESPCAMFW-45]** ✅ Kconfig-based board selection — `board_config` component
  with `choice BOARD_TARGET` (LilyGo / AI Thinker / Olimex); `include/board.h`
  restored as compile-time macro generator for `BOARD_HAS_*`, `BOARD_PSRAM_SIZE_MB`,
  `BOARD_SENSOR_OV*`, `BOARD_CAM_PIN_*`; `WIFI_MANAGER_ENABLED` default migrated
  from `SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED` to `BOARD_HAS_WIFI`; all 3 firmware builds verified;
  75 host tests, 0 failures
- **[ESPCAMFW-42]** ✅ status_indicator component — compile-time backend
  selection (display / LED / log-only) via Kconfig; LEDC PWM blink patterns
  for 7 states; deterministic FreeRTOS task shutdown via task notification;
  active-low inversion; per-board sdkconfig.defaults fragments tracked in git;
  8 Unity host tests; 75 total host tests across 5 suites
- **[ESPCAMFW-41]** ✅ wifi_manager component — WiFi connection lifecycle
  (init, connect, disconnect, auto-reconnect with exponential backoff),
  NVS credential storage ("wifi_cfg" namespace), APP_EVENT_WIFI_CONNECTED /
  APP_EVENT_WIFI_DISCONNECTED events, Bluetooth RF guard on ESP32 non-S3;
  stub implementation on Olimex (CONFIG_WIFI_MANAGER_ENABLED=n); 10 Unity
  host tests; firmware verified on all 3 boards
- **[ESPCAMFW-12]** ✅ sys_log component — per-module tags & macro wrappers,
  sys_log_set_level() runtime API, sys_log_print_system_info() boot diagnostics
- **[ESPCAMFW-13]** ✅ nvs_config component — NVS-backed key/value config store,
  typed getters/setters, default values, Unity host tests
- **[ESPCAMFW-40]** ✅ nvs_config extended — network_mode_t enum (WIFI/ETHERNET/BOTH),
  network_mode field in app_config_t; NVS key "net_mode" (uint8_t); validation
  with (unsigned) cast; default NETWORK_MODE_WIFI; 5 new host tests (39 total
  in nvs_config suite, 57 across all suites)
- **[ESPCAMFW-14]** ✅ app_event component — centralized FreeRTOS event loop,
  event bitmask API, shutdown/reboot events, Unity host tests
- **[ESPCAMFW-15]** ✅ power_manager component — TWDT 30 s, ISR with
  IRAM_ATTR/DRAM_ATTR, graceful shutdown via APP_EVENT_SHUTDOWN,
  8 Unity host tests
- **[ESPCAMFW-35]** ✅ Test infrastructure — Unity 2.6.0 vendored, mock headers,
  test/Makefile, CI test job parallel to build
- **[ESPCAMFW-38]** ✅ [env:native] PlatformIO environment — pio test -e native
  runs host tests across 4 suites; custom runner resolves Unity duplication
  conflict with PlatformIO 6; both pio test and make -f test/Makefile work
- **[ESPCAMFW-39]** ✅ Multi-platform platformio.ini — three target board
  environments; board headers (boards/) temporarily removed pending
  ESPCAMFW-45; Kconfig-based WiFi gating (CONFIG_WIFI_MANAGER_ENABLED)
  proven and in place
- **[Infra]** ✅ Repository scaffold: platformio.ini, CMakeLists.txt, src/main.c
- **[Infra]** ✅ sdkconfig.defaults, partitions/partitions_ota.csv
- **[Infra]** ✅ Agent context: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .agent/ guidelines

- **[Infra]** ✅ scripts/pre-pr.ps1, scripts/hooks/pre-commit
- **[Infra]** ✅ .github/workflows/ci.yml, release.yml, PR/issue templates
- **[Docs]** ✅ DEVELOPMENT.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/adr/ADR-001
- **[chore]** ✅ Public repository cleanup — LICENSE (Apache 2.0), SECURITY.md,
  internal references removed from all docs and templates
